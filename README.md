## More Details:

This was a study made for a large heart failure institute in the US. 

Medicare penalizes hospitals every time a patient is readmitted, therefore it is important to understand the nature of readmissions in order to direct resources in order to reduce it.

EDA and Visualization were written in R. 
Built linear regressions and naive bayes to understand variable importance but not used.
